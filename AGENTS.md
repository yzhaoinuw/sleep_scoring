# Codex Memory For This Project

## Runtime Environment

When running code, tests, or the desktop app for this repository, use the conda environment:

- `sleep_scoring_dash3.0`

Typical startup:

```powershell
conda activate sleep_scoring_dash3.0
```

After activation, use that environment for commands such as:

- `pytest`
- `python run_desktop_app.py`
- package import checks
- one-off scripts

## Git Ownership Note

If Git reports a "detected dubious ownership" warning for this repo, mark this repository as safe:

```powershell
git config --global --add safe.directory C:/Users/yzhao/python_projects/sleep_scoring
```

This is the preferred fix unless the repository ownership itself needs to be changed at the OS level.

## Commit Message Guidelines

Commit messages should use:

- a short title line
- a short body with flat bullet points for additional requested changes when a commit contains multiple user-requested updates

Commit message bullets should describe high-level added or changed behavior, not implementation details.

For feature commits, mention only the user-facing behavior that was added or changed.

Do not mention tests, docs, project memory updates, or behind-the-scenes implementation details in a feature commit message unless that internal work is itself the main purpose of the commit.
